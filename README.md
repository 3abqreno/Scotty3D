# Scotty3D

Scotty3D is the 3D modeling, rendering, and animation package that students complete as part of [15-462/662 Computer Graphics](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.

The current version of the starter code is available at https://github.com/CMU-Graphics/Scotty3D .

## Mesh Editing
In here we provide a plethra of mesh editing tools.
this was acomplished using half edge data structure for connectivity and some geometry for caluclations.

### Local operations

below are some examples of the implemented local operations.
